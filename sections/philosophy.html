  <h2>Obito Uchiha's Philosophy</h2>

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>Pain is the price of reality</h3>
    <p>
      Obito believes that pain and suffering are inseparable parts of life. 
      To truly understand reality, one must face hardships. Escaping pain 
      means being unable to confront the harsh truths of the world.
    </p>

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>The ideal world can only be built through dreams</h3>
    <p>
      Obito dreamed of a world without sorrow and suffering. He saw reality as 
      full of pain and believed that the only way to achieve true peace was 
      to create a new world, implementing the "Eye of the Moon Plan" to impose 
      an ideal dream on humanity.

    <h3>True friendship never dies</h3>
    <p>
      Despite turning into Tobi and committing many wrongs, Obito's heart still 
      longed for his bonds with Kakashi and Rin. In the end, he helped his friends 
      and sacrificed himself for them, proving that genuine human connections endure.

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>Power without purpose is meaningless</h3>
    <p>
      Obito realized that strength alone is not enough. Purpose and vision give 
      power its true meaning. This belief drove him to execute his plan in pursuit 
      of what he saw as an ideal world.
