      <p>
        Obito Uchiha was a kind-hearted and determined child from the Uchiha clan, 
        who dreamed of becoming the Hokage to be acknowledged by everyone. During 
        the Third Great Ninja War, he was thought to have died after being crushed 
        by a boulder while saving his teammate Kakashi Hatake. However, he was 
        secretly rescued by Madara Uchiha, who manipulated Obito and instilled 
        in him a new vision of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Madara's guidance, Obito adopted the persona of "Tobi" and later 
        became one of the central antagonists of the Fourth Great Ninja War. He 
        orchestrated the Akatsuki organization, manipulated wars behind the scenes, 
        and sought to implement the Eye of the Moon Plan, aiming to create an ideal 
        world through the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his descent into darkness, Obito’s original compassion remained 
        buried inside him. His final redemption came during his fight against 
        Kaguya Otsutsuki, when he sacrificed himself to protect Naruto Uzumaki 
        and Sasuke Uchiha, showing that his heart was never truly lost. Obito's 
        story is a powerful tale of love, loss, redemption, and the enduring human 
        spirit.

  <h2>Obito Uchiha's Philosophy</h2>

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>Pain is the price of reality</h3>
    <p>
      Obito believes that pain and suffering are inseparable parts of life. 
      To truly understand reality, one must face hardships. Escaping pain 
      means being unable to confront the harsh truths of the world.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>The ideal world can only be built through dreams</h3>
    <p>
      Obito dreamed of a world without sorrow and suffering. He saw reality as 
      full of pain and believed that the only way to achieve true peace was 
      to create a new world, implementing the "Eye of the Moon Plan" to impose 
      an ideal dream on humanity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>True friendship never dies</h3>
    <p>
      Despite turning into Tobi and committing many wrongs, Obito's heart still 
      longed for his bonds with Kakashi and Rin. In the end, he helped his friends 
      and sacrificed himself for them, proving that genuine human connections endure.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="philosophy-item">
    <h3>Power without purpose is meaningless</h3>
    <p>
      Obito realized that strength alone is not enough. Purpose and vision give 
      power its true meaning. This belief drove him to execute his plan in pursuit 
      of what he saw as an ideal world.

      <p>
        I understand Obito because I have seen the same world he saw a reality built on pain, loss, and suffering.
        I do not deny this truth. The world is cruel, and dreams are often born only to be broken.
        But this is where our paths diverge. Obito chose to escape reality, to create an illusion where pain no longer exists.
        I refuse that escape. I believe pain is not a reason to surrender, but proof that I am still alive, still standing, still fighting.
        If reality is harsh, then I will become stronger than it.
        My dream will not be born in a false world, but in this one among wounds, tears, and struggle.
        I do not seek to flee from suffering; I seek to forge meaning from it.
        If I am close to Obito, then I am the version of him who chose confrontation over collapse, purpose over illusion, and the courage to fight until the end.

    Obito Uchiha’s life is a story of profound tragedy, loss,
     and ultimate redemption. Once a kind-hearted, optimistic
      boy with dreams of becoming Hokage and protecting those 
      he loved, he was abruptly thrust into darkness by Rin’s 
      tragic death and the relentless manipulations of Madara Uchiha.
       Consumed by grief and anger, he adopted the persona of Tobi,
        orchestrating wars, spreading chaos,
         and inflicting immense suffering upon the world. Yet, even behind the mask of an antagonist,
          Obito’s true heart remained, secretly yearning for peace, understanding,
           and the possibility of a world free from pain. His internal struggle between vengeance and compassion, 
           despair and hope, showcases the complexity of human nature. Ultimately,
            Obito’s journey reminds us that even those who stray into the deepest shadows are not beyond redemption;
             through courage, self-awareness, and the love of others, one can confront their past,
              make amends, and illuminate a path back to righteousness, leaving a lasting legacy of sacrifice,
               resilience, and the enduring power of the human spirit.
