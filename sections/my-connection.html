        I understand Obito because I have seen the same world he saw a reality built on pain, loss, and suffering.
        I do not deny this truth. The world is cruel, and dreams are often born only to be broken.
        But this is where our paths diverge. Obito chose to escape reality, to create an illusion where pain no longer exists.
        I refuse that escape. I believe pain is not a reason to surrender, but proof that I am still alive, still standing, still fighting.
        If reality is harsh, then I will become stronger than it.
        My dream will not be born in a false world, but in this one among wounds, tears, and struggle.
        I do not seek to flee from suffering; I seek to forge meaning from it.
        If I am close to Obito, then I am the version of him who chose confrontation over collapse, purpose over illusion, and the courage to fight until the end.
